#!/bin/bash

# ============================================
# Script: upload_to_remote.sh
#
# Uploads a local directory or file to a remote VM (e.g., on FABRIC testbed) via SCP.
# - Directories are compressed into a .tar.gz for faster transfer (it is generally much faster to zip a folder and then unzip than upload every file for example)
# - Files are transferred directly
# Supports IPv4, IPv6, and custom SSH config files.
#
# Note: do not forget to specify the REMOTE_DIR when uploading a file to make sure it goes to the correct path on the remote!
# ============================================

# === Input arguments ===
LOCAL_PATH=$1       # Path to local directory or file (e.g., ./kubespray or ./kubespray/dynamos-cluster/inventory.ini)
SSH_KEY=$2          # Path to your SSH private key (e.g., ~/.ssh/slice_key)
SSH_CONFIG=$3       # Path to your custom SSH config (e.g., ./ssh_config)
# These vairables are added at the end (before optional arguments to avoid interference) so they can easily 
# be changed with different users and remote IPs
REMOTE_USER=$4      # Username on the remote node (e.g., ubuntu)
REMOTE_IP=$5        # IP address of the remote node (IPv4 or IPv6 without brackets)
# Optional: remote directory (defaults to ~)
# ~ will automatically resolve to the user's home directory, such as /home/ubuntu
# Use it with "" around the ~ to avoid it already resolving it locally and going to the local machine's home path
REMOTE_DIR="${6:-"~"}"

# === Validation ===
# Ensure exactly 5 or 6 (includes optional arguments) are specified ($0 is the filename)
